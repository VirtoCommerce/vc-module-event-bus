The module enables you to be notified of new Virto Commerce events or changes via a Message Queue of your choice.

The module is used to trigger an asynchronous background process in response to an event on the Virto Commerce platform.

![Event Bus Schema Overview](docs/media/event-bus-overview.PNG)

As a payload, a Virto Commerce Event delivers one of the predefined Messages or any Change to a resource.

That enables event-driven, reactive programming. It uses a publish-subscribe model. Publishers emit events but have no expectation about which events are handled. Subscribers decide which events they want to handle.

The event description is based on CloudEvents: "specification for describing event data in a common way".
